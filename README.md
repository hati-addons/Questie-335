# Questie-335

A fork of the WoW Classic **Questie** addon aiming to provide compatibility with **Ascension (Bronzebeard)**.

## Installation
- [Download](https://github.com/3majed/Questie-335/releases) the archive.
- Extract it into the `Interface/AddOns/` directory. The folder name should be `Questie-335`.
- If you are playing on a custom server that emulates a previous expansion using the **3.3.5** client, you can add `-Classic` or `-TBC` to the addon folder name to load only the required files for the chosen expansion.
- If your server doesn't provide a patch for the world map, enable the in-game setting: `Options → Advanced → Use WotLK map data`.

## Fixes
- **Nameplates**
  - Skips **Ascension Nameplates** and works with other addons.

- **Tracker**
  1. Compatible with the Ascension API and doesn't fail with auto-turn-in quests.
  2. No more missing header issues.
  3. Refreshes correctly when accepting, completing, or abandoning quests.

- **Tooltips**
  1. Fixed all errors.
  2. New: shows if an NPC drops an item that starts a quest.

- **Custom IDs**
  - Supports large integer IDs.

- **Minimap**
  - Fixed errors when zooming the minimap.

- **World Map**
  1. Supports Ascension `WorldMapFrame` when minimized and draws icons correctly.
  2. Works with **Mapster** and **Magnify-WotLK**.

- **New Content (Maps & Quests)**
  - Currently supports **Elwynn Forest only**.
